"Whispers of the Ciphered Veil"

In whispers of the digital age, a secret's bond,
Through ciphers' dance and cryptic song,
A key turns, silent in the lock,
Guarding the gate where secrets talk.

In shadows cast by lines of code,
Lies the enigma's hallowed abode,
Where silence reigns, and words are weighed,
And privacy's shield shall never fade.
